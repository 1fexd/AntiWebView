# AntiWebView

Have you ever used horrible apps like Reddit which display ALL external links opened through their
shitty app in a Android WebView ("in-app browser") which does not allow you to open the clicked link
in a browser?

AntiWebView is a simple LSPosed/LSPatch module which hooks WebViews in any app and display a
notification allowing the user to open the link in their browser.
